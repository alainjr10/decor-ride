# Decorride

Decorride is an Interior Decor mobile app which allows users to easily leverage the power of AR to create aesthetically pleasing visual designs of their homes.

With decorride, we have the ability to select items from a catalogue of 3d items, and place them virtually on your real environment.

# Motivation
- The motivation of this project is to get more immersive and improve AR skills with flutter.
- Creating this project gave me the ability to really dive into augmented reality experience in flutter, with a view of expanding this knowledge even   further in the future.
- With decorride, users can easily place virtual objects on their real world environment.

# Features
At the moment, this is still a starter project with a majority of features still to be implemented. however, at the moment, a user can
- Create an Ideabook
- Add ideas to the ideabook
- Try out the AR view

# How to try out AR View
Given that that was the main goal of this application, we focused on that first, while creating and adding more as time goes on. To try out the AR  View, you can either
1. -  Click on the > Demo AR View `Demo AR View` from the homescreen
    - Click on the `Add` Button on the bottom right, and then proceed to select an item from the available items.
    - Follow the onscreen directions to scan the environment and then place your product on your environment when  scanning is complete. ![Decorride homescreen](assets/doc_assets/Screenshot_20230831-161833-min.png)
